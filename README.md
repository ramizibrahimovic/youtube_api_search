# Youtube API Search Replica
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>A replication of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">Youtube's</a> search function with real data.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This project helped me to combine my html/css with my javascript skills by using real data from the Youtube API to recreate the search function.</p>
<p>Download this repo and try yourself! You can switch between the 2 profiles and also have a look on the timeline of both.</p>
